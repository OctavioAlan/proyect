# proyect
I'm looking for someone who has already used FLASK-PYTHON, CSS, JS Y HTML. 
In this case, I'm seeking help with the design of 3 templates, the first part being the login page, 
the second part being the payment method (which includes a free part, a pay-per-project part, and a monthly subscription part), 
and the third part being the home page where the user sees the options available. I want my design to be attractive to users. 
The application is for statistical analysis, so I'm seeking a technological look. I don't want to use any pre-registered templates. 
The design should use colors and images that evoke trust, growth, and enthusiasm. If you have any designs to show from your past work, 
that would be great. I'll share the code with you where I want you to incorporate the new designs. In this case, 
you'll only be changing what's already there to the new design.
I would also like to know how I can share the code where I want you to make the changes since I am making other changes from 
there to the modules, I don't know if it is by mail or by other means
